Description: 
    Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but predicting patient
    response remains challenging. Here, we presented Intelligent Predicting
    Response to cancer Immunotherapy through Systematic Modeling (iPRISM), a
    novel network-based model that integrates multiple data types to predict
    immunotherapy outcomes. It incorporates gene expression, biological
    functional network, tumor microenvironment characteristics, immune-related
    pathways, and clinical data to provide a comprehensive view of factors
    influencing immunotherapy efficacy. By identifying key genetic and
    immunological factors, it provides an insight for more personalized
    treatment strategies and combination therapies to overcome resistance
    mechanisms.
